SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. This information can be if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

# Objective

To assist other companies who wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

# Goals

Create a machine learning model to predict the if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, and therefore determine the cost of the launch. 

# Dataset

The dataset will be collected from [SpaceX website](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets/)
